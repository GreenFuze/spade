# LLM-Based RIG Generation Statistics Log

This information must be accurate for academic paper. the data must be precise with up to 2 digits after the decimal point. You must not miss any information. If in doubt, add the information you are not sure of.

## Methodology

### Experimental Setup
- **Model**: OpenAI GPT-5-nano with temperature=0 (deterministic best effort)
- **Framework**: agentkit-gf with pydantic_ai backend
- **Environment**: Windows 10, Python 3.12
- **Repositories**: MetaFFI (large, multi-language), cmake_hello_world (small, C++), jni_hello_world (medium, C++/Java)
- **Evaluation**: Evidence-based accuracy assessment against ground truth

### Architecture Evolution
- **V1-V3**: Single agent, JSON-based approach
- **V4**: Eight-phase agent architecture with JSON generation and parsing
- **V5**: Direct RIG manipulation architecture (proposed)

### Accuracy Measurement
- **Phase 1 (Repository Overview)**: Directory structure, build system detection, language identification
- **Phase 2 (Source Structure)**: Component detection, file classification, dependency analysis
- **Complete Pipeline**: End-to-end RIG generation with validation

### Statistical Rigor
- **Precision**: All timing measurements to 0.1 second accuracy
- **Token Counts**: Exact token usage from OpenAI API responses
- **Reproducibility**: Temperature=0 ensures deterministic behavior
- **Validation**: Manual verification against repository ground truth

## Detailed Test Results

### T001: V3 Discovery Agent - MetaFFI Repository (2024-12-28)
- **Repository**: MetaFFI (Large multi-language CMake project)
- **Test Type**: Discovery Phase Only
- **Agent**: V3 DiscoveryAgent with improved context management
- **Context Management**: Clean, current directory only
- **Request Limit**: Disabled via `usage_limits=None`

**Discovered Information**:
- Build System: CMake with version 3.10+
- Configuration Files: Root CMakeLists.txt and multiple cmake module files
- Source Directories: metaffi-core, lang-plugin-python311, lang-plugin-openjdk, lang-plugin-go
- Test Directories: metaffi-core/plugin-sdk
- Test Framework: CTest via CMake enable_testing

**Technical Improvements**:
- Glob Filtering: Added `glob_pattern` parameter to `list_dir` tool for efficient filtering
- Natural Exploration: LLM starts by listing root directory, then explores based on what it finds
- Evidence-Based Rules: "ALWAYS use list_dir to see what files exist before trying to read them"
- Build System Guidance: LLM follows build system references naturally, not arbitrary file scanning

### T002: V3 Classification Agent - MetaFFI Repository (2024-12-28)
- **Repository**: MetaFFI (Large multi-language CMake project)
- **Test Type**: Classification Phase Only
- **Agent**: V3 ClassificationAgent with discovery results input
- **Context Management**: Clean, using discovery results as input

**Components Discovered**:
- Core MetaFFI (metaffi-core): Core library and build orchestration
- Python 3.11 Plugin (lang-plugin-python311): Language plugin with Python 3.11
- OpenJDK Plugin (lang-plugin-openjdk): Language plugin with Java (OpenJDK)
- Go Plugin (lang-plugin-go): Language plugin with Go
- CTest-based Tests: Testing framework integration

**Key Achievements**:
- Evidence-Based Classification: All components backed by clear evidence
- Line-Level Evidence: Specific CMakeLists.txt references and file paths
- Component Relationships: Properly identified subcomponents and dependencies
- Language Detection: Correctly identified Python, Java, and Go components
- Test Framework Detection: Identified CTest integration

## Key Learnings

### Context Management
- **Problem**: Large repositories cause context explosion and path hallucination
- **Solution**: Clean context management with current directory only
- **Result**: Successful exploration of large repositories like MetaFFI

### Evidence-Based Approach
- **Problem**: LLM making assumptions about file existence
- **Solution**: Always verify file existence through directory listing first
- **Result**: No more "file not found" errors

### Model Settings
- **Problem**: Invalid parameters in ModelSettings
- **Solution**: Use only valid parameters (temperature=0)
- **Result**: Proper model configuration without errors

### Glob Filtering
- **Enhancement**: Added glob pattern support to list_dir tool
- **Benefit**: More efficient file filtering and exploration
