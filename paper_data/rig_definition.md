# Mathematical Definition of the Repository Intelligence Graph (RIG)

## Abstract

The Repository Intelligence Graph (RIG) represents a novel mathematical framework for the canonical, evidence-based representation of build system components, dependencies, and relationships within software repositories. This document provides a comprehensive formal mathematical definition of the RIG as a directed graph structure, establishing theoretical foundations for its completeness in covering repository structure and demonstrating optimization strategies for Large Language Model (LLM) consumption. The RIG serves as a bridge between traditional build system analysis and modern AI-driven code understanding, providing a mathematically rigorous foundation for automated repository intelligence.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Motivation and Context

Modern software repositories exhibit complex, multi-layered dependency structures that traditional build system analysis tools struggle to represent comprehensively. The RIG addresses this challenge by providing a mathematically rigorous, evidence-based representation that captures the full complexity of build systems while remaining optimized for AI consumption.

### 1.2 Theoretical Foundations

The RIG is grounded in graph theory, evidence-based reasoning, and formal verification principles. It provides a complete, canonical representation that serves as a single source of truth for repository structure, enabling both human analysis and automated AI-driven code understanding.

### 1.3 Scope and Applications

The RIG framework supports diverse build systems including CMake, Maven, npm, Cargo, Python, Go, and others, providing a unified mathematical foundation for cross-platform repository analysis. Applications include automated code understanding, dependency analysis, build optimization, and AI-assisted development.

## 2. Formal Graph Definition

### 2.1 Basic Graph Structure

**Definition 2.1** (Repository Intelligence Graph): Let $G = (N, E)$ be a directed graph where:

- $N$ is the finite set of nodes representing repository entities
- $E \subseteq N \times N$ is the set of directed edges representing relationships between entities

**Definition 2.2** (Graph Properties): The RIG $G$ satisfies the following properties:

1. **Finiteness**: $|N| < \infty$ and $|E| < \infty$
2. **Acyclicity**: The dependency subgraph $(N_{component}, E_{depends})$ is acyclic
3. **Evidence Completeness**: Every node and edge is associated with evidence $\epsilon: N \cup E \rightarrow \mathcal{E}$

### 2.2 Mathematical Foundations

The RIG is constructed from evidence-based analysis of repository structure, ensuring that every element has a traceable origin in the source repository. This evidence-based approach provides mathematical guarantees about the accuracy and completeness of the representation.

### 1.2 Node Types

The node set $N$ is partitioned into disjoint subsets:

$$N = N_{component} \cup N_{aggregator} \cup N_{runner} \cup N_{utility} \cup N_{test}$$

Where:

- $N_{component}$: Build components (executables, libraries, packages)
- $N_{aggregator}$: Build aggregators (CMake targets, Maven modules)
- $N_{runner}$: Test runners and execution environments
- $N_{utility}$: Utility tools and scripts
- $N_{test}$: Test definitions and test suites

### 1.3 Edge Types

The edge set $E$ is partitioned into relationship types:

$$E = E_{depends} \cup E_{tests} \cup E_{includes} \cup E_{links} \cup E_{external}$$

Where:

- $E_{depends}$: Build dependency relationships
- $E_{tests}$: Test relationships
- $E_{includes}$: Include/import relationships
- $E_{links}$: Link relationships
- $E_{external}$: External dependency relationships

## 2. Component Classification

### 2.1 Component Types

Each component $c \in N_{component}$ has a type function:

$$\tau: N_{component} \rightarrow \{executable, static\_library, dynamic\_library, package\_library\}$$

### 2.2 Runtime Classification

Each component has a runtime environment:

$$\rho: N_{component} \rightarrow \{native, JVM, Python, Node.js, Go, \ldots\}$$

### 2.3 Programming Language

Each component has an associated programming language:

$$\lambda: N_{component} \rightarrow \{C++, Java, Python, JavaScript, Go, \ldots\}$$

## 3. Evidence-Based Architecture

### 3.1 Evidence Function

Every node and edge is associated with evidence:

$$\epsilon: N \cup E \rightarrow \mathcal{E}$$

Where $\mathcal{E}$ is the set of evidence structures containing:
- File paths and line numbers
- Source code content
- Build system references
- Configuration file entries

### 3.2 Evidence Completeness

For any entity $x \in N \cup E$, the evidence $\epsilon(x)$ must satisfy:

$$\forall e \in \epsilon(x): \text{file\_path}(e) \in \text{repository\_files} \land \text{line\_number}(e) \in \mathbb{N}^+$$

This ensures all evidence is traceable to actual repository content.

## 4. Relationship Semantics

### 4.1 Dependency Relationships

For $(u, v) \in E_{depends}$:

- $u$ requires $v$ to be built before $u$ can be built
- $\text{type}(u) \in \{executable, static\_library, dynamic\_library\}$
- $\text{type}(v) \in \{static\_library, dynamic\_library, package\_library\}$

### 4.2 Test Relationships

For $(t, c) \in E_{tests}$:

- $t \in N_{test}$ tests component $c \in N_{component}$
- $\text{test\_framework}(t) \in \{CTest, JUnit, pytest, \ldots\}$

### 4.3 Transitive Closure

The dependency relationship is transitive:

$$\forall (u, v), (v, w) \in E_{depends}: (u, w) \in E_{depends}^*$$

Where $E_{depends}^*$ is the transitive closure of $E_{depends}$.

## 5. RIG Completeness Theorem

### 5.1 Repository Coverage

**Theorem**: The RIG $G = (N, E)$ is complete with respect to repository $R$ if:

$$\forall \text{build\_target} \in R: \exists n \in N \text{ such that } \text{represents}(n, \text{build\_target})$$

$$\forall \text{dependency} \in R: \exists e \in E \text{ such that } \text{represents}(e, \text{dependency})$$

### 5.2 Evidence Completeness

**Theorem**: The RIG is evidence-complete if:

$$\forall n \in N, \forall e \in E: \epsilon(n) \neq \emptyset \land \epsilon(e) \neq \emptyset$$

This ensures every entity in the RIG has supporting evidence from the repository.

## 6. LLM Optimization

### 6.1 JSON Representation

The RIG is serialized as a JSON structure $J$ where:

$$J = \{\text{repository\_info}, \text{build\_system\_info}, \text{components}, \text{relationships}\}$$

### 6.2 Token Optimization

The JSON representation is optimized for LLM consumption through:

#### 6.2.1 Entity Mapping
$$\mathcal{M}: \text{entities} \rightarrow \text{IDs}$$

Maps verbose entity names to compact identifiers.

#### 6.2.2 Evidence Compression
$$\mathcal{C}: \text{evidence} \rightarrow \text{compressed\_evidence}$$

Compresses evidence while preserving essential information.

#### 6.2.3 Relationship Optimization
$$\mathcal{O}: \text{relationships} \rightarrow \text{optimized\_relationships}$$

Optimizes relationship representation for minimal token usage.

### 6.3 Optimization Function

The total optimization is:

$$\mathcal{T} = \mathcal{M} \circ \mathcal{C} \circ \mathcal{O}$$

This reduces token count while preserving RIG completeness and evidence integrity.

## 7. RIG Properties

### 7.1 Acyclicity

**Property**: The dependency subgraph $(N_{component}, E_{depends})$ is acyclic.

$$\nexists \text{cycle in } (N_{component}, E_{depends})$$

This ensures build dependencies form a valid DAG.

### 7.2 Evidence Preservation

**Property**: All evidence is preserved through optimization.

$$\forall e \in \text{original\_evidence}: \exists e' \in \text{optimized\_evidence}: \text{equivalent}(e, e')$$

### 7.3 Completeness Preservation

**Property**: Optimization preserves RIG completeness.

$$\text{complete}(\text{original\_RIG}) \Rightarrow \text{complete}(\text{optimized\_RIG})$$

## 8. LLM Consumption Optimization

### 8.1 Token Efficiency

The optimized RIG minimizes token usage while maintaining:

- **Completeness**: All repository information is preserved
- **Evidence**: All evidence remains traceable
- **Relationships**: All dependencies and relationships are maintained
- **Context**: Sufficient context for LLM understanding

### 8.2 JSON Structure Optimization

The optimized JSON structure uses:

- **Compact identifiers** instead of verbose names
- **Compressed evidence** with essential information only
- **Optimized relationships** with minimal redundancy
- **Structured hierarchy** for efficient parsing

### 8.3 LLM-Friendly Format

The final JSON is structured for optimal LLM consumption:

```json
{
  "repository": {
    "name": "repo_name",
    "build_system": "cmake",
    "language": "C++"
  },
  "components": [
    {
      "id": "comp1",
      "type": "executable",
      "runtime": "native",
      "evidence": ["file:line"],
      "deps": ["comp2"]
    }
  ],
  "relationships": [
    {
      "source": "comp1",
      "target": "comp2",
      "type": "depends_on",
      "evidence": ["file:line"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## 9. Conclusion

The RIG provides a mathematically rigorous, evidence-based representation of repository structure that is both complete and optimized for LLM consumption. The formal definition ensures:

1. **Completeness**: All repository information is captured
2. **Evidence**: All conclusions are backed by repository content
3. **Optimization**: Minimal token usage for LLM efficiency
4. **Consistency**: Mathematical properties ensure data integrity

This foundation enables reliable, deterministic RIG generation and consumption by LLM agents for repository analysis and code development tasks.
