# LLM0 Phases Detail - Agent Behavior Analysis

## Abstract

The LLM0 Repository Intelligence Graph (RIG) generation system represents a novel approach to automated build system analysis through Large Language Model (LLM) orchestration. This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the evolution from JSON-based agent architecture (V4) to direct RIG manipulation architecture (V5), detailing the behavioral patterns, evidence-based methodologies, and technical implementation of each specialized agent. The system employs deterministic LLM interactions with temperature 0 (greedy sampling) to ensure reproducible, evidence-based repository analysis across diverse build systems including CMake, Maven, npm, Cargo, and others.

## Version History

### V4 Architecture (JSON-Based)
The initial eight-phase agent architecture employed JSON generation and parsing, where each agent generated JSON representations of RIG data that were subsequently converted back to RIG objects. This approach, while functional, introduced serialization issues and type safety concerns.

### V5 Architecture (Direct RIG Manipulation)
The evolved architecture eliminates JSON conversion entirely, enabling direct RIG object manipulation through specialized tools. This approach provides type safety, eliminates serialization issues, and enables incremental RIG building through all phases.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 System Architecture Overview

The LLM0 RIG generation system implements a sophisticated eight-phase agent architecture designed to systematically analyze software repositories and generate canonical, evidence-based representations of build components, dependencies, and relationships. The architecture has evolved from JSON-based generation (V4) to direct RIG manipulation (V5), with each phase employing a specialized agent optimized for specific aspects of repository analysis, with clean context management and evidence-based approaches.

### 1.2 V5 Architecture: Direct RIG Manipulation

The V5 architecture represents a fundamental shift from JSON-based agent communication to direct RIG object manipulation. This approach eliminates serialization issues, provides type safety through Pydantic models, and enables incremental RIG building through all phases.

**Key V5 Innovations:**
- **Single RIG Instance**: One RIG object passed through all phases, growing incrementally
- **Direct Object Manipulation**: LLM agents work directly with RIG objects via specialized tools
- **Type Safety**: Pydantic models ensure data integrity throughout the process
- **No JSON Conversion**: Eliminates serialization issues and data loss
- **Incremental Building**: Each phase adds its specialized knowledge to the growing RIG
- **Application-Level Tools**: Specialized tools for RIG manipulation in each phase

### 1.2 Core Design Principles

**Evidence-Based Architecture**: All conclusions must be backed by first-party evidence from repository files, build system configurations, and source code analysis. No heuristics or assumptions are permitted.

**Deterministic Behavior**: Temperature 0 (greedy sampling) ensures reproducible results across multiple runs, critical for research and production applications.

**System Agnostic**: The architecture supports any build system without code modifications, enabling analysis of CMake, Maven, npm, Cargo, Python, Go, and other build systems.

**Context Isolation**: Each agent receives only relevant context from previous phases, preventing context pollution and enabling targeted optimization.

**Fail-Fast Philosophy**: When evidence is insufficient, the system reports UNKNOWN rather than making assumptions, ensuring data integrity.

## 2. Phase 1: Repository Overview Agent

### 2.1 Purpose and Scope

The Repository Overview Agent serves as the initial reconnaissance phase, performing high-level structural analysis and build system identification. This agent establishes the foundational understanding of the repository's architecture, build systems, and exploration scope for subsequent phases.

### 2.2 Behavioral Analysis

#### 2.2.1 Natural Exploration Methodology

The agent employs a systematic exploration strategy that begins with directory listing operations to establish ground truth about file existence. This evidence-based approach prevents path hallucination and ensures all subsequent operations are based on verified file presence.

**Exploration Sequence**:
1. **Root Directory Analysis**: Initial `list_dir` operation to catalog available files and directories
2. **Build System Detection**: Identification of build system configuration files through pattern matching
3. **Directory Classification**: Categorization of directories by purpose (source, test, build, documentation)
4. **Entry Point Discovery**: Identification of main configuration files and project entry points
5. **Scope Definition**: Determination of exploration priorities for subsequent phases

#### 2.2.2 Evidence-Based File Access Protocol

The agent implements a strict evidence-based file access protocol that requires verification of file existence before any read operations. This protocol prevents the common LLM failure mode of attempting to access non-existent files.

**Verification Protocol**:
- **Pre-Read Verification**: All file access operations must be preceded by directory listing verification
- **Glob Pattern Filtering**: Efficient file discovery using pattern matching (e.g., `*.cmake`, `CMakeLists.txt`)
- **Existence Confirmation**: Files are only read if their existence is confirmed through directory operations
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing files with context updates

#### 2.2.3 Build System Guidance Strategy

Rather than arbitrary file scanning, the agent follows build system logic to guide exploration. This approach ensures efficient analysis while maintaining evidence-based principles.

**Guidance Mechanisms**:
- **Configuration File Priority**: Build system configuration files receive highest priority
- **Dependency Chain Following**: Natural exploration following build system dependency chains
- **Framework Detection**: Identification of testing frameworks and development tools
- **Language Detection**: Analysis of file extensions and content for programming language identification

### Input
- Repository path
- No previous context (clean slate)

### Output
```json
{
  "repository_info": {
    "path": "repository_path",
    "build_systems": [
      {
        "type": "string (discovered from evidence)",
        "version": "string|UNKNOWN",
        "config_files": ["path1", "path2"],
        "api_available": true|false,
        "evidence": "string describing what evidence led to this conclusion"
      }
    ],
    "source_directories": ["path1", "path2"],
    "test_directories": ["path1", "path2"]
  },

        "evidence": "string describing what evidence led to this conclusion"
      }
    ]
  }

### Critical Rules
- ALWAYS use list_dir to see what files exist before trying to read them

## V5 Architecture: Direct RIG Manipulation

### 5.1 Architectural Evolution

The V5 architecture represents a fundamental paradigm shift from JSON-based agent communication to direct RIG object manipulation. This evolution addresses critical limitations in the V4 architecture while maintaining the eight-phase structure and evidence-based methodology.

### 5.2 Core V5 Principles

#### 5.2.1 Single RIG Instance Flow
```
Phase 1: Create RIG → Add repository info → Pass RIG to Phase 2
Phase 2: Receive RIG → Add source components → Pass RIG to Phase 3  
Phase 3: Receive RIG → Add test components → Pass RIG to Phase 4
Phase 4: Receive RIG → Add build analysis → Pass RIG to Phase 5
Phase 5: Receive RIG → Add artifacts → Pass RIG to Phase 6
Phase 6: Receive RIG → Classify components → Pass RIG to Phase 7
Phase 7: Receive RIG → Add relationships → Pass RIG to Phase 8
Phase 8: Receive RIG → Finalize and validate → Return complete RIG
```

```python
class RIGTools:
    def __init__(self, rig_instance):
        self.rig = rig_instance
    
    def add_component(self, name, type, **kwargs):
        """Add a component to the RIG with type safety"""
        component = Component(name=name, type=type, **kwargs)
        self.rig.add_component(component)
        return f"Added component: {name}"
    
    def add_relationship(self, source, target, type, evidence):
        """Add a relationship to the RIG with evidence"""
        relationship = Relationship(
            source=source, 
            target=target, 
            type=type, 
            evidence=evidence
        )
        self.rig.add_relationship(relationship)
        return f"Added relationship: {source} -> {target}"
```

#### 5.3.2 Agent Architecture
```python
class BaseLLMAgentV5:
    def __init__(self, repository_path, rig_instance, agent_name):
        self.rig = rig_instance  # Shared RIG instance
        self.rig_tools = RIGTools(rig_instance)  # RIG manipulation tools
        self.file_tools = FileTools(repository_path)  # File operations
        self.process_tools = ProcessTools(repository_path)  # Process operations
        
        # Create agent with all tools
        self.agent = DelegatingToolsAgent(
            model="openai:gpt-5-nano",
            tool_sources=[self.rig_tools, self.file_tools, self.process_tools],

## V4+ Phase 8 Enhancement Strategy (2024-12-28)

### 8.1 Problem Analysis: V4 Phase 8 Context Explosion

**Root Cause Identification**:
The V4 architecture demonstrates excellent performance in phases 1-7 (92.15% average accuracy) but fails at Phase 8 due to context explosion when generating the complete RIG from all previous phases.

**Technical Analysis**:
- **Phases 1-7**: Efficient with focused, individual tasks
- **Phase 8 (RIG Assembly)**: Must combine ALL results from phases 1-7 into single JSON
- **Context Size**: Exponential growth in context size for Phase 8
- **LLM Limitations**: Overwhelmed by excessive context in single operation

**Architecture Comparison**:
| Approach                   | Phases 1-7                | Phase 8                     | Context Management      | Implementation Risk |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------- |
| **V4 (Current)**           | ✅ Efficient (92.15%)      | ❌ Context explosion         | Good for 1-7, bad for 8 | Low                 |
| **V5 (Direct RIG)**        | ❌ Context pollution (85%) | ❌ Context pollution         | Poor throughout         | High                |
| **V6 (Incremental)**       | Complex changes           | Complex changes             | Phase-specific          | High                |
| **V4+ (Enhanced Phase 8)** | ✅ Efficient (unchanged)   | ✅ Step-by-step RIG building | Good throughout         | Low                 |

### 8.2 V4+ Solution Architecture

**Core Strategy**: Enhance only Phase 8 of V4 architecture with RIG manipulation tools.

**Technical Implementation**:
```
Phase 1-7: V4 JSON-based (unchanged, proven efficient)
Phase 8: Enhanced with RIG manipulation tools
  - Use RIG tools to build RIG step-by-step
  - No huge JSON generation
  - Context stays small
  - Data stored in RIG instance
```

**Key Technical Benefits**:
- **Maintains V4 Efficiency**: Phases 1-7 unchanged (proven 92.15% accuracy)
- **Solves Phase 8 Context Explosion**: No huge JSON generation
- **Step-by-step RIG Building**: LLM can work incrementally
- **Data Stored in RIG**: No context pollution
- **Focused Enhancement**: Only Phase 8 modified, minimal risk

### 8.3 Enhanced Phase 8 Agent Design

**RIGAssemblyAgentV4Enhanced Architecture**:
```python
class RIGAssemblyAgentV4Enhanced:
    def __init__(self, repository_path, rig_instance):
        self.rig = rig_instance
        self.rig_tools = RIGTools(rig_instance)
        self.validation_tools = ValidationTools(rig_instance)
    
    async def execute_phase(self, phase1_7_results):
        # Step 1: Read Phase 1-7 results (small context)
        # Step 2: Use RIG tools to build RIG incrementally
        # Step 3: Validation loop after each operation
        # Step 4: Fix mistakes if validation fails
        # Step 5: Repeat until complete
```

**RIG Manipulation Tools**:

- `add_build_system_info()` - Add build system details from Phase 4
- `add_component()` - Add source components from Phase 2
- `add_test()` - Add test components from Phase 3
- `add_relationship()` - Add relationships from Phase 7
- `get_rig_state()` - Get current RIG state for validation
- `validate_rig()` - Validate RIG completeness and consistency

**Validation Loop Strategy**:
```python
async def build_rig_with_validation(self, phase_results):
    for operation in self.get_operations(phase_results):
        # Execute operation
        result = await self.execute_operation(operation)
        
        # Validate result
        validation = await self.validate_rig()
        
        if not validation.is_valid:
            # LLM fixes mistakes
            await self.fix_mistakes(validation.errors)
            # Re-validate
            validation = await self.validate_rig()
        
        if not validation.is_valid:
            raise Exception(f"Validation failed: {validation.errors}")
