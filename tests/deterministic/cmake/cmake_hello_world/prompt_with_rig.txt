You are an expert at analyzing code repositories and build systems.

You have been provided with structured metadata about this repository in the following JSON:

In the following JSON, you'll find these entity types:

- **Components**: Build components (executables, libraries, runnable artifacts like JARs or Python files). Each component must generate an artifact from source files, or be the source files themselves if interpreted.
- **Aggregators**: Build steps that don't generate artifacts but invoke or depend on other build steps.
- **Runners**: Execution or test runners that don't generate artifacts.
- **Test Definitions**: Tests that contain a component used for testing or a runner that executes the test.

Please answer the following questions about this repository using the metadata above and by analyzing the repository files.

IMPORTANT: Write your answers to a file named "answers.json" in the root of this repository.

The answers.json file must be a JSON array with this exact format:
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "answer": "your answer here"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "answer": ["list", "of", "items"]
  }
]

For answers that are lists, use JSON arrays. For yes/no questions, answer with "yes" or "no".

Questions:

1. What is the CMake project name?
2. What is the minimum CMake version required?
3. How many .cpp files are in the src/ directory?
4. How many .h files are in the src/ directory?
5. What directory contains the source files?
6. How many add_test commands are in the CMakeLists.txt?
7. How many target_link_libraries commands are in the CMakeLists.txt?
8. Is enable_testing() called in this project? (Answer yes or no)
9. How many lines are in the CMakeLists.txt file?
10. How many find_package commands are in the CMakeLists.txt?
11. How many buildable components are in this repository?
12. What are the names of all output artifacts produced by this build on Windows? (Provide a list)
