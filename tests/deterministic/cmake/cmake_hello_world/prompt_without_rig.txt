You are an expert at analyzing code repositories and build systems.

Please answer the following questions about this repository. Analyze the repository structure, build files, and source code to provide accurate answers.

When answering questions, you should understand these common build system terms:

- **Components**: Build components (executables, libraries, runnable artifacts like JARs or Python files). Each component generates an artifact from source files, or is the source files themselves if interpreted.
- **Aggregators**: Build steps that don't generate artifacts but invoke or depend on other build steps (e.g., "build-all" targets).
- **Runners**: Execution or test runners that don't generate artifacts.
- **Tests**: Test suites that use a component for testing or a runner that executes the test.

IMPORTANT: Write your answers to a file named "answers.json" in the root of this repository.

The answers.json file must be a JSON array with this exact format:
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "answer": "your answer here"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "answer": ["list", "of", "items"]
  }
]

For answers that are lists, use JSON arrays. For yes/no questions, answer with "yes" or "no".
