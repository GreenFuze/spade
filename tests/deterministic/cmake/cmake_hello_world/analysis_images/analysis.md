## Executive Summary

This analysis evaluates the effectiveness of RIG (Repository Information Generation) on agent performance for the **cmake_hello_world** repository. 
Three agents (Claude, Codex, Cursor) answered 30 questions both with and without access to RIG metadata.

**Key Finding**: RIG improved average agent performance by **2.2 percentage points** 
(95.6% → 97.8%) while reducing average completion time by **1.2%** 
(51.3s → 50.7s).

## 4. Efficiency Analysis

![Efficiency Scatter Plot](cmake_hello_world_efficiency_scatter.png)

This scatter plot shows the relationship between time and accuracy for each agent. 
Arrows indicate the direction of change when RIG is introduced. 
The ideal trajectory is toward the upper-left (higher score, less time).

**Interpretation**:
- **Claude**: improved both speed and accuracy
- **Codex**: became both slower and less accurate
- **Cursor**: improved both speed and accuracy
