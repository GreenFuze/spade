## 4. Efficiency Analysis

![Efficiency Scatter Plot](metaffi_efficiency_scatter.png)

This scatter plot shows the relationship between time and accuracy for each agent. 
Arrows indicate the direction of change when RIG is introduced. 
The ideal trajectory is toward the upper-left (higher score, less time).

**Interpretation**:
- **Claude**: improved both speed and accuracy
- **Codex**: improved both speed and accuracy
- **Cursor**: improved both speed and accuracy
