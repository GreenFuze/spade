## Executive Summary

This analysis evaluates the effectiveness of RIG (Repository Information Generation) on agent performance for the **embedded_system** repository. 
Three agents (Claude, Codex, Cursor) answered 30 questions both with and without access to RIG metadata.

**Key Finding**: RIG improved average agent performance by **8.9 percentage points** 
(85.6% → 94.4%) while reducing average completion time by **56.9%** 
(170.3s → 73.3s).

## 4. Efficiency Analysis

![Efficiency Scatter Plot](embedded_system_efficiency_scatter.png)

This scatter plot shows the relationship between time and accuracy for each agent. 
Arrows indicate the direction of change when RIG is introduced. 
The ideal trajectory is toward the upper-left (higher score, less time).

**Interpretation**:
- **Claude**: improved both speed and accuracy
- **Codex**: improved both speed and accuracy
- **Cursor**: improved both speed and accuracy
