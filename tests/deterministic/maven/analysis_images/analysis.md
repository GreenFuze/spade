## Executive Summary

This analysis evaluates the effectiveness of RIG (Repository Information Generation) on agent performance for the **maven** repository. 
Three agents (Claude, Codex, Cursor) answered 30 questions both with and without access to RIG metadata.

**Key Finding**: RIG improved average agent performance by **5.5 percentage points** 
(91.1% → 96.7%) while reducing average completion time by **35.4%** 
(104.7s → 67.7s).

## 4. Efficiency Analysis

![Efficiency Scatter Plot](maven_efficiency_scatter.png)

This scatter plot shows the relationship between time and accuracy for each agent. 
Arrows indicate the direction of change when RIG is introduced. 
The ideal trajectory is toward the upper-left (higher score, less time).

**Interpretation**:
- **Claude**: improved both speed and accuracy
- **Codex**: became both slower and less accurate
- **Cursor**: improved both speed and accuracy

An honest assessment of RIG's impact, showing both improvements and regressions:

### Questions Fixed by RIG

- **Claude**: 2 questions (12, 13)
- **Codex**: None
- **Cursor**: 5 questions (12, 13, 19, 24, 30)

### Questions Broken by RIG

- **Claude**: 1 questions (21)
- **Codex**: None
- **Cursor**: 1 questions (22)

### Net Impact

- **Claude**: +1 questions (net improvement)
- **Codex**: 0 questions (net improvement)
- **Cursor**: +4 questions (net improvement)

## Conclusions

RIG demonstrates measurable value for the **maven** repository:

1. **Significant accuracy improvement**: +5.5 percentage points average
2. **Substantial time savings**: 35.4% average reduction
3. **Most benefit**: Cursor saw 13.3% improvement

**Recommendation**: RIG provides measurable value for maven and should be adopted.
