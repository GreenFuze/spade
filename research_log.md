# SPADE Research Log

## Research Process Log

**2024-12-19 14:30** - Started SPADE project research. Need to understand how to infer software architecture from codebases using LLMs. Decided to start with directory structure analysis only to validate the core concept before adding complexity.

**2024-12-19 14:35** - Chose Python implementation because of rich LLM ecosystem and good file system operations. Need cross-platform compatibility for research flexibility.

**2024-12-19 14:40** - Decided on object-oriented design to make the codebase maintainable and extensible. This will allow us to add deeper analysis phases later without major refactoring.

**2024-12-19 14:45** - Scope Phase 0 to directory-only analysis. Reasoning: want to test if LLMs can infer architecture from structure alone before adding code parsing complexity. This gives us a baseline for comparison.

**2024-12-19 14:50** - Chose `llm` Python package for LLM access. Provides standardized interface across multiple providers and has built-in error handling. Default to `gpt-5-nano` for cost-effectiveness during research.

**2024-12-19 14:55** - Designed comprehensive telemetry system from day one. Need data to validate our research hypotheses and measure inference accuracy. This will help us understand what works and what doesn't.

**2024-12-19 15:00** - Implemented noise filtering for common directories like `.git`, `node_modules`, `__pycache__`. These don't contribute to architectural understanding and would add noise to LLM analysis.

**2024-12-19 15:05** - Created CLI interface with configurable depth and entry limits. Need flexibility to test on repositories of different sizes and complexity levels. Unlimited mode (0) for comprehensive research.

**2024-12-19 15:10** - Structured output as JSON in `.spade/` directory. Machine-readable format allows for automated analysis of results and comparison across different repositories.

**2024-12-19 15:15** - Added deterministic sorting for reproducible results. Important for research validation - need consistent inputs to measure LLM inference accuracy.

**2024-12-19 15:20** - Implemented UTF-8 encoding support. Many repositories have international filenames, and we need to handle them properly for accurate analysis.

**2024-12-19 15:25** - Created research log format. Need to track our thinking process and decisions to understand the research evolution and validate our approach.

**2024-12-19 15:30** - Identified key research questions: How accurate is directory-based inference? What patterns can be reliably detected? How does repository size affect quality? What are optimal prompts?

**2024-12-19 15:35** - Planned future phases: Phase 1 (AST analysis), Phase 2 (dependency graphs), Phase 3 (pattern recognition), Phase 4 (quality metrics). Each phase builds on previous to create comprehensive architecture understanding.

**2024-12-19 15:40** - Next research steps: Test on diverse repositories, validate against known architectures, analyze telemetry data, refine prompts based on results. Need empirical data to guide development.

**2024-12-19 16:00** - Started new research session. Need to create proper research log format as specified in project rules. Realized previous log was too technical - should focus on research thinking process, not implementation details.

**2024-12-19 16:05** - Rewrote research log to follow chronological format: "[timestamp] - [what we changed and why concisely]". This better captures our research evolution and decision-making process rather than technical documentation.

**2024-12-19 16:10** - Identified that research log should track thinking process, not code changes. The knowledgebase.md file already handles technical documentation, so research log should focus on research methodology and rationale.

**2024-12-19 16:15** - Established clear separation: research_log.md for research thinking process, knowledgebase.md for technical implementation details. This allows new team members to quickly understand both our research approach and technical decisions.

**2024-12-19 16:20** - Started code refactoring to improve separation of concerns. Need to split agent.py into multiple files for better maintainability and extensibility.

**2024-12-19 16:25** - Refactored agent.py to contain only base Agent class and common utilities. Moved DirectorySnapshot to its own file for better modularity and reuse across different phases.

**2024-12-19 16:30** - Created phase0.py with Phase0Agent inheriting from base Agent class. This establishes a clean inheritance hierarchy for future phases while keeping Phase 0 specific logic separate.

**2024-12-19 16:35** - Updated main.py to import from phase0 module instead of agent. This maintains clean separation between base functionality and phase-specific implementations.

**2024-12-19 16:40** - Added info-level logging for working directory to provide better user feedback. Users will now see which directory is being analyzed in STDOUT.
